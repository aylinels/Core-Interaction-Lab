   <p class= "text1">Given a prompt or constraint from the Oblique Strategies deck, I was assigned to redesign the card 12 different ways using only html and css that respond to the prompt or constraint on the card. Each card should be different in some way. This assignment is about exploring objectivity, systems, and concepts. The idea is to remove as many aesthetic decisions from the design process as possible.</p>

 <p class= "text2">Create a website that responds graphically to the current time using only typography. Not only should your site respond to the current time when loaded, it should also respond to the passing of time as the user stays on the site. This assignment is about leveraging the browser to create a living site that changes over time.</p>
