<p class= "text1">New York City is filled with trucks—containers transporting anything from food and tools to money and trash. For this first exercise, I had to create two html pages that must somehow link to one another while recreating it within the browser.</p>

<a  class= "check3" href="https://aylinels.github.io/Core-Interaction-Lab/programming-plants/">Check it out →</a>
<p class= "text3">I had to create a small plant out of html and css. Using the setInterval function we reviewed last class to program the plant to slowly change overtime. Utilizing responsive units like %, vw, vh, this plant had to be responsive: not only to browser width but also to browser height.</p>

<p class= "text4">This group project explored conventions and outputs of a single Javascript event handler, considered as a deep-dive into a found interaction. We decided to recreate Thesaurus' website and speficially the click interaction that showcased all the different synonyms depending on the different meaning of the word.</p>

    <div class= "project5">Collection Prélude</div>
<a  class= "check5" href="https://collection-prelude-color.glitch.me/">Check it out →</a>
<p class= "text5">This group project acted as a prelude of my Collections project for Core Studio. After finding a common theme between our collections, we had to create 4 interactions (filters, hovers, buttons, scrolling, etc) to view and modify our combined mini-collection of 20 images total.</p>
